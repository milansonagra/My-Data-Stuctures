<h2>Simplified DES Encryption algorithm</h2>
<p>
This is a simplified DES algorithm. Simplified DES (SDES) was designed for educational purposes only, to help students learn about modern cryptanalytic techniques. I have implemented S-DES algorithm for learning perpous only.

This algorithm takes 8-bit of input(plain text) and generate 8-bit cypher text using given 10-bit key. The space & time complexity of this program is O(n).
